# #570 interactive isolation spike

Branch: `feat/570-untrusted-pty-isolation`, stacked on `7ad148409ce6e700778bdd73e2b0a046eca6aca4` (#575).

## Changes and decisions

Followed brief v2 and its addendum. The cancelled HTTP draft is preserved in stashes named `570 option B draft` and `570 option B draft tests`. Added a disposable-CI-only real-Claude suite with six property groups (transcript cleanup has an independent pair), captures of the supervisor's actual argv, and control-removed twins whose baseline assertions must fail. No real model calls or credentials were used locally.

Added cleanup of the unique temporary cwd's external Claude project transcript directory after PTY retirement. `--no-session-persistence` remains in the shared constant for parity, but is documented print-only by installed Claude **2.1.304**. Cleanup failure propagates; unrelated project transcripts are preserved. The unit test drives `runOnceOnPty` and captures its actual spawn options. The existing registry-wide argv contract already covers both CLI engines and remains intact.

PTY still advertises `caps.isolation: false`, and implicit untrusted routing still selects print. No README or engine-default change is permitted before live evidence. HTTP engines remain explicit opt-in.

## Local verification

- `env -u ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL bun test src/oneshot src/__tests__/session-actions-argv.test.ts`: **171 pass, 4 skip, 0 fail**.
- `bun test src/__tests__/pty-process.test.ts src/__tests__/pty-supervisor.test.ts src/__tests__/pty-supervisor-mcp.test.ts`: **161 pass, 0 fail**.
- Integration file run from `tests/integration` locally: guarded suite skipped; no canaries or authentication attempted. After adding an independent transcript pair the suite contains 14 live tests, not part of the default unit suite.
- Whole-repo `bun run lint`: exit 0, **0 errors, 1301 warnings, 324 infos**.
- `bun run typecheck`: exit 0, **149 errors against baseline 149**, no regression.
- Both version scripts: plugin and marketplace **2.2.345**.

## Fault injection evidence

One site at a time, each restored before the green run. Initial new test failed because its cleanup module did not exist. The meaningful mutation checks were:

Dropping only `--disable-slash-commands` from the PTY argv:

```text
(fail) the actual untrusted PTY spawn preserves the complete shared isolation argv [31.70ms]
```

Disabling only transcript removal:

```text
(fail) removes external transcripts and the empty cwd after success [5.65ms]
(fail) removes external transcripts and the empty cwd after failure [2.08ms]
```

Restored `pty-process.ts` has no diff; restored unit run: **3 pass, 0 fail, 13 assertions**. No injected faults remain.

## CI evidence

Pending first dispatch. The real probe table and run URL will be recorded after the workflow settles. Authentication uses only the existing workflow's step-scoped secret environment. Raw screens, transcripts and environment contents are never emitted by the new suite. Negative controls report caught assertion failures as `RED-with-control-removed` lines.

## Scope and remaining work

No prior-art code copied. The existing shared isolation argv and supervisor test seams were reused. Leave `.planning/559-pty-submit/`, `.serena/`, scratchpads and other pre-existing untracked state untouched. A Claude security review follows before any PR. If any live baseline or negative-control assertion fails, retain the isolation gate and stop at the spike.
