/**
 * Graceful drain on shutdown (#315).
 *
 * `systemctl restart` while an agent turn is in flight used to kill that turn
 * with no guard and no signal: the reply the user was waiting on was gone and
 * nothing said so. #318 exposed the busy signal (`/api/health` → `busy`) so
 * an external guard can wait; this is the daemon-side half — on SIGTERM, wait
 * for the bus to owe the model nothing, bounded, and say what happened.
 *
 * What "busy" covers is `BusCore.busyAgents()`: a turn in flight, and every
 * prompt the bus still holds for the model (in-flight delivery, queued behind
 * an initialising session, held through a compaction, carried over a socket
 * close, turn-start still being verified). A prompt that reached the model
 * and whose reply is being sent is covered by the settle grace after the last
 * turn ends — nothing awaits outbound adapter sends, so the drain gives them
 * a moment.
 *
 * The verdict is honest about HOW an agent stopped being busy. The bus also
 * clears an agent's turn when its IPC connection closes, or on a `cancel` /
 * `error` from the agent — and a connection close is exactly what happens
 * when the service manager signals the whole control group and the `claude`
 * child dies with the daemon (systemd `KillMode=control-group`, the
 * default). The drain cannot tell those three apart, so it reports them as
 * one class, "ended without a turn_end", never as finished; the deploy doc
 * says to use `KillMode=mixed` so the child outlives the signal.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT done here: refusing new prompts during the drain. The
 * adapters do not turn a `sendPrompt` rejection into a message to the user,
 * so a refusal would be a silent drop of a different kind. Consequence: under
 * steady inbound traffic the drain chains turns and runs to the window.
